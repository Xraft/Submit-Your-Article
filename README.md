# Submit Your Article
This repository includes tutorial and support materials about how to submit your article to Xraft.Lab.

## Format ##

Xraft.Lab's webpage is built on github, so currently we only support  **github flavor**  markdown article. Since this blog is supported by hexo, you can set detail information in  **front matters**  .
Roughly structure follow this:

        ---
        title: [Title of your article ] 
        date: [Recording your time of creating this article. Example: 2018-02-19 22:51:19]
        tags: [Optional, you can specify it, we will help allocate and adjust approparate tags]
        categories: [Optional, you can specify it, we will help allocate and adjust approparate categories]
        ---
        
        And put your github flavor markdown here.

## If you need use images ##  

**For local images:**  
Create new folder called 'img', put images you want to use in it, and quote it with relative path in your article.
                      
        ![xx](./img/test.png)

**For images on Internet:**  
Directly quote it in your markdown.
